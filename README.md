# Ruby Enumerable
For this projects, I learned how to work with yields, classes and modules in ruby. I created a class called MyList
which contains an instant variable List and a method called each that loops through the list variable. In another file
I created a module called enumerables which contains built in ruby mehods implemented using yields and that functions
in conjunction with the class.
